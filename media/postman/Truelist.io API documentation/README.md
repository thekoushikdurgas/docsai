Welcome to Truelist's api! <br /> To get started, <a href='https://app.truelist.io/settings/api-keys'>generate an api key</a>. You'll use the API key in an `Authorization` header in every request.<br /> <strong>A note about rate limits:</strong>  Each endpoint has a rate limit.  If you exceed the rate limit, you'll get a `429` error.  The rate limit is <strong>10 requests per second</strong>.  This rate limit is specifically for API calls.  The email validation rate limit is different and is based on your plan.
