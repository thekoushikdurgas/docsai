Complete GraphQL API collection for Contact360 Appointment service.

**Canonical config:** The spec-compliant Postman configuration (PostmanConfiguration with endpoint_mappings) is **contact360.json** in the parent `postman/` folder. It includes a **GraphQL Dashboard** folder with the four dashboard operations (User Stats, List Activities, List Exports, Get Usage) linked via endpoint_mappings to `media/endpoints`. The files in this folder are reference/import format; use contact360.json for DocsAI validation and relationship linking.

2. Create environment with baseUrl
3. Use Auth > Login to get token
4. Token auto-saves to environment

**Modules:** All 25 GraphQL modules included

**📚 For comprehensive module documentation**, see docs/GraphQL/README.md which includes detailed queries, mutations, validation rules, error handling, and implementation details for each module.
