Postman collection for the Contact360 FastAPI backend. Core business logic (Authentication, Users, Contacts, Companies, Billing, Usage) is now handled by Connectra service. This collection includes v1 endpoints (Imports, Bulk), v2 endpoints (AI Chat, Apollo, Email, Email Patterns, LinkedIn, Exports, Gemini REST endpoint, Activities), v3 endpoints (S3 Files, Cleanup, Email Pattern, Analysis, Validation), and v4 endpoints (Sales Navigator scraping). Note: For GraphQL API, Gemini operations are now available through the AI Chats module. All endpoints require Bearer token authentication via Connectra. Sample parameters align with docs/api/ai_chat.md, docs/api/apollo.md, docs/api/email.md, docs/api/pattern.md, docs/api/linkdin.md, docs/api/export.md, docs/api/insert.md, docs/api/scrape.md, docs/api/s3.md, docs/api/cleanup.md, docs/api/email_pattern.md, docs/api/analysis.md, docs/api/validation.md, and docs/api/activities.md.
